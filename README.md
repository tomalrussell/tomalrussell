### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on climate risks to infrastructure systems and sustainable long-term planning [**@nismod**](https://github.com/nismod) as a senior research software engineer in the [OPSIS](https://opsis.eci.ox.ac.uk/author/tom-russell/) research group in the University of Oxford.

Since early 2022, I'm also a fellow of the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/fellows/tom-russell), planning to collaborate and share knowledge and software skills around open data about buildings and the built environment.
